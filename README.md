## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A running backend server (as indicated by `https://global-nexus-backend.vercel.app` in the fetch requests).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Reazul87/REACT_ASSIGNMENT_B12A10.git
    cd global-nexus
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    You might need a `.env` file in the root directory for things like Firebase configuration (for authentication) or the backend API URL.

    ```
    # Example .env content
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG
    VITE_USER_EMAIL=welcome@gmail.com
    VITE_USER_PASSWORD=Welcome123

    # ... other firebase configs
    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://global-nexus-backend.vercel.app
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

2.  **Ensure the backend server is running:**
    This application communicates with a backend server, which is assumed to be running at `https://global-nexus-backend.vercel.app`. Make sure your backend is properly set up and running for full functionality.
